      heading: 'Why Weekly Synthesis',
      content: `The weekly synthesis is your highest-leverage reflection habit. It forces pattern recognition across days that individually feel noisy.

Bridgewater's key insight: **the machine that produces outcomes is more important than any individual outcome.** Weekly synthesis is when you inspect the machine.`,

    {
      heading: 'Step 1: Goals',
      content: `What are you trying to achieve this period?

- Be specific and measurable
- Distinguish between "nice to have" and "must achieve"
- Maximum 3 goals — more than 3 means you haven't prioritized
- Connect each goal to a thesis pillar (AI, Markets, Mind)`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 2: Problems',
      content: `What problems are blocking your goals?

- Be brutally honest — denial is the #1 failure mode
- Distinguish root causes from symptoms
- Auto-problems are surfaced from your daily data (low GE, missed focus hours, NS spikes)
- The system pre-populates problems from your reward component trends`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 3: Diagnosis',
      content: `Why do these problems exist?

- Go deeper than the obvious answer
- Use "5 Whys" — ask why 5 times
- Look for patterns across weeks, not just this week
- Common root causes: overcommitment, avoidance, skill gap, environment design`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 4: Design',
      content: `What changes to the machine will fix the root causes?

- Design changes to systems, not just willpower
- Each design should have a clear trigger and action
- Connect designs to specific problems from Step 3
- Think in terms of: what process change would make this problem impossible?`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Step 5: Execute',
      content: `What specific actions will you take next week?

- Maximum 5 actions — fewer is better
- Each action should be concrete enough to know if you did it
- Assign to specific days where possible
- Review execution in next week's synthesis`,
    },
