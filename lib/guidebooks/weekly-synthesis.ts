Bridgewater insight: **the machine producing outcomes matters more than any single outcome.** Weekly synthesis inspects the machine.`,

- Specific, measurable
- Separate "must achieve" from "nice to have"

- Each linked to a pillar (AI, Markets, Mind)`,

- Be brutal — denial is the #1 failure mode
- Root causes, not symptoms
- System auto-surfaces problems from daily data (low GE, missed focus, NS spikes)`,

- Go deeper than obvious answers
- Use "5 Whys"
- Look for cross-week patterns
- Common roots: overcommitment, avoidance, skill gap, bad environment`,

- Change systems, not willpower
- Each design: clear trigger + action
- Connect to specific Step 3 problems
- Ask: what process change makes this problem impossible?`,

      content: `Specific actions for next week.
- Max 5 — fewer is better
- Concrete enough to verify completion
- Assign to specific days
- Review execution in next synthesis`,
