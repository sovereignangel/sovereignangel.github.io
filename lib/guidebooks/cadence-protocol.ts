      content: `Cadence is the rhythm of reflection and action. Without it, you oscillate between reactive firefighting and paralyzed overthinking.

Each interval serves a different cognitive function:
- **Daily** — Tactical awareness, energy management
- **Weekly** — Pattern recognition, machine inspection
- **Monthly** — Strategic course correction
- **Quarterly** — Thesis-level review, identity evolution`,

      heading: 'Daily Cadence',
      content: `**Morning (5 min):**
- Log energy inputs (sleep, training, NS state)
- Set focus intention for the day
- Check capital position (1 min)

**Evening (5 min):**
- Log output (hours, ships, asks)
- Rate PsyCap (hope, efficacy, resilience, optimism)
- Flag any signals worth capturing

The daily cadence feeds your g* score. Consistency here is the foundation.`,
