# ELITE GOALS: $0 → $10M+ NET WORTH PLAN
## Bridgewater-Style Audit for Wealth, Skills, Gravitas & Influence

**Current State:** $0 Net Worth (savings - debt = ~$0)
**Target:** $10M+ Net Worth by 2030 (4-5 years)
**Required CAGR:** ~200% (aggressive but achievable in tech/AI/markets)

**Supporting Dimensions:**
- Elite technical skills (AI research capability)
- Business gravitas (trusted by VCs, founders, institutions)
- Public influence (thought leader in AI + Markets)
- Network quality (access to capital, talent, customers)

---

## PART 1: WEALTH BUILDING PATH ($0 → $10M+)

### 1.1 The Math: What It Actually Takes

**The brutal truth:**
You cannot save your way to $10M in 4 years. Even at $200k/year salary, saving 50% = $100k/year × 4 years = $400k.

**The only paths to $10M:**
1. **Equity in a breakout company** (founder, early employee)
2. **Fund management fees** (2/20 on $50M+ AUM)
3. **Asset appreciation** (real estate, crypto, stocks - but requires capital you don't have)
4. **Combination:** Revenue → invest → equity → compound

**Your asymmetric bet:** Armstrong → Fund → GP equity

### 1.2 Net Worth Milestones (2026-2030)

| Year | Target Net Worth | Primary Source | Key Milestone |
|------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **2026 (Current)** | $0 | Starting point | Revenue: $6k→$12k/mo |
| **2026 (End)** | $150k | Armstrong revenue + savings | $12k/mo MRR sustained |
| **2027** | $500k | Fund launch (2/20 on $10M AUM) | First fund close |
| **2028** | $1.5M | Fund growth ($30M AUM) + equity | Armstrong exit or scale |
| **2029** | $4M | Fund ($50M AUM) + portfolio | GP equity vesting |
| **2030** | $10M+ | Fund ($100M AUM) + exits | Institutional credibility |

**Assumptions:**
- Armstrong scales to $150k/year revenue (2026)
- Fund launches with $10M AUM (2027) → 2% mgmt fee = $200k, 20% carry = TBD
- Fund grows to $50M AUM (2029) → $1M/year mgmt fee + carry
- Armstrong either exits ($500k-2M) or scales to $500k/year MRR
- Manifold kills or scales (upside optionality)

### 1.3 Revenue Milestones (Extended from Current Goals)

**2026:**
| Month | Revenue Target | Cumulative YTD | Net Worth Impact |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Mar 2026 | $6k | $6k | +$3k (50% savings rate) |
| Apr 2026 | $8k | $14k | +$7k |
| May 2026 | $10k | $24k | +$12k |
| Jun 2026 | $12k | $36k | +$18k |
| Jul 2026 | $14k | $50k | +$25k |
| Aug 2026 | $16k | $66k | +$33k |
| Sep 2026 | $18k | $84k | +$42k |
| Oct 2026 | $20k | $104k | +$52k |
| Nov 2026 | $22k | $126k | +$63k |
| Dec 2026 | $24k | $150k | +$75k |

**2026 End State:**

- Saved: $75k cash (50% savings rate)
- Invested: $75k (index funds, 7% return)
- Net Worth: **$150k**

**2027:**
- Armstrong: $30k/month MRR ($360k/year)
- Fund launch: $10M AUM → $200k/year mgmt fee (first year)
- Total income: $560k
- Savings (50%): $280k
- Net worth: **$150k + $280k = $430k**

**2028:**
- Armstrong: $40k/month MRR ($480k/year) OR exit for $1M
- Fund: $30M AUM → $600k/year mgmt fee + carry starts vesting
- Total income: $1M+
- Net worth: **$1.5M**

**2029:**
- Fund: $50M AUM → $1M/year mgmt fee + $500k carry (from 2027 vintage)
- Armstrong: Exited or scaled to $500k/year
- Net worth: **$4M**

**2030:**
- Fund: $100M AUM → $2M/year mgmt fee + $2M carry
- GP equity value: $5M+

## PART 4: INFLUENCE & NETWORK QUALITY

### 4.1 Network Quality (Not Quantity)

**Bridgewater principle:** Quality of network >> size of network

**Your network should include:**

| Category | Who | Why | Target Count (2026) |
|----------|-----|-----|---------------------|
| **Top VCs** | Partners at Sequoia, a16z, Founders Fund | They can fund you, introduce LPs | 5-10 |
| **Elite Founders** | Building $10M+ ARR companies | They're customers, co-investors, peers | 10-20 |
| **Top Researchers** | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, academia | Intellectual credibility, collaboration | 5-10 |
| **Potential LPs** | Family offices, HNW individuals, funds | They'll invest in your fund | 20-30 |
| **Media / Influencers** | Tech journalists, podcast hosts | Amplify your work | 5-10 |
| **Operators** | VP Eng, VP Sales at unicorns | Can help you scale Armstrong | 5-10 |

**Current state:** Early network, mostly peers
**Target state:** One text away from top-tier capital, talent, customers

### 4.2 Network Building Actions

**Daily:**
- [ ] Engage with 1 high-status person on Twitter (thoughtful reply, not spam)
- [ ] DM 1 person you admire (ask 1 specific question, offer value)

**Weekly:**
- [ ] 3 discovery conversations (1 VC, 1 founder, 1 researcher)
- [ ] Introduce 2 people who should know each other (give first)
- [ ] Share someone else's work (not just your own)

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Host 1 dinner or event (bring 5-10 interesting people together)
- [ ] Appear on 1 podcast or write 1 guest post (borrow their audience)
- [ ] Ask 1 high-status person: "Who should I know?"

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Review: Who are the 10 most valuable relationships?
- [ ] Double down: Deepen those 10 (help them, collaborate, stay top of mind)
- [ ] Prune: Stop spending time on low-value connections

### 4.3 Influence Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target (2026) | Target (2030) |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Twitter Followers** | ? | 10k | 100k+ |
| **Blog Subscribers** | ? | 1k | 10k+ |
| **Podcast Appearances** | 0 | 5 | 50+ |
| **Inbound Intros** | Rare | Weekly | Daily |
| **Media Mentions** | 0 | 5 | 50+ |
| **Speaking Invitations** | 0 | 3 | 20+/year |
| **Believability (1-10)** | 4 | 7 | 9 |

**How to measure believability:**
- Quarterly: Ask 5 high-status people to rate you 1-10 on domain expertise
- Track: Do people implement your advice?
- Track: Do VCs/founders ask for your opinion?

     → ACTION: 3 discovery calls this week

  🟢 Technical skills on track (Stanford RL progressing)
```

## PART 7: THE CRITICAL QUESTION: CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO THIS?

### 7.1 The Honest Assessment

**Going from $0 → $10M net worth in 4-5 years requires:**

1. **Armstrong scales to $24k/month by Dec 2026** (6x growth in 9 months)
   - Achievable? Yes, if you make 3 asks/day and don't fragment
   - Risk: Product-market fit failure, churn, asking anxiety

2. **Fund launches with $10M AUM in 2027**
   - Achievable? Maybe. Requires relationships with 10-15 LPs (HNW, family offices)
   - Risk: No track record, no credibility, can't close LPs

3. **You become research-level credible in AI + Markets**
   - Achievable? Yes, if you finish Stanford RL + publish 1 paper
   - Risk: Imposter syndrome, perfectionism, tutorial hell

4. **You build gravitas fast enough to be taken seriously**
   - Achievable? Yes, if you ship consistently + build in public
   - Risk: Over-optimization, hiding, not asking for what you want

### 7.2 The Bottleneck Analysis

**Bridgewater would ask: What's the constraint?**

**It's not intelligence:** You're smart enough.
**It's not work ethic:** You'll put in the hours.
**It's not opportunity:** AI + Markets is the right intersection.

**The bottleneck is CAPTURE RATIO (κ):**
- You create value (build things, have insights)
- But you don't ask for money (low κ)
- Result: Brilliant but broke

**The fix:**
- 3 asks/day (minimum, non-negotiable)
- Ship → Ask (within 24 hours of shipping)
- Track conversion rate (get better at closing)
- Raise prices every quarter (signal: you're valuable)

**If you fix κ, everything else compounds.**

### 7.3 The Systematic Approach

**You can't willpower your way to $10M.**

**You need:**
1. **Systems** (daily asks, weekly ships, monthly network building)
2. **Triggers** (if revenue < target for 8 weeks → kill or pivot)
3. **Feedback loops** (LPs tell you if fund thesis is good, customers tell you if product is valuable)
4. **External calibration** (VCs, founders, researchers rate your progress)

**This is why the Thesis Engine exists:**
- Track κ daily (are you capturing value?)
- Track network quality (who trusts you?)
- Track gravitas (are you known for anything?)
- LLM surfaces patterns (you're avoiding asks when GE < 0.7)

**The system makes $10M inevitable, not hopeful.**
