## I. THESIS STATEMENT

I am building a bootstrapped micro PE holdco that incubates, operates, and captures equity across asymmetric AI-native ventures — funded by revenue first, outside capital only after proof.

**The mechanism:** Extract insight. Validate with revenue. Connect capital + idea + operator. Own meaningful equity in the outcome.

**The edge:** A compounding meta-research engine that increases idea quality, conviction accuracy, and deal flow density over time — combined with an operator who can build the product herself.

**The north star metric:** Long-term equity ownership in asymmetric systems I helped architect, funded primarily by the systems themselves.

## II. WHAT GAME I AM PLAYING

### What This Is

A bootstrapped micro PE holdco. Capital-light, insight-heavy, equity-concentrated.

**The model:** Incubate ventures with sweat equity and minimal capital. Prove revenue. Then selectively raise a preseed to accelerate the winner — from a position of leverage, not need.

Closest analogues:
- **Tiny Capital** — buy/build small profitable internet businesses, hold forever
- **Andrew Wilkinson's holdco model** — operator-led, bootstrap-first, raise only to accelerate
- **Early Foundry Group** — small, surgical, conviction-driven

### What This Is Not

| I am not optimizing for | I am optimizing for |
|---|---|
| Salary maximization | Autonomous equity ownership |
| Fund size prestige | Compounding insight leverage |
| Title optics | Creative control + direct operating leverage |
| LP politics | Surgical asymmetric bets |
| Headcount | Network-amplified solo execution |

### The Differentiator

Most operators choose: build one thing, or allocate capital to many things.

I do both — but with a meta-layer. The Thesis Engine is an embedded research lab that makes every subsequent bet higher conviction than the last. The portfolio doesn't just generate returns. It generates *better judgment*.

## III. INVESTMENT CRITERIA — THE CONVEXITY FILTER

Every venture in the portfolio must pass the convexity test:

### Definition

**Convex** = asymmetric payoff profile. Small input, potentially very large output. Downside capped, upside uncapped. The payoff curve bends upward like a call option.

### Scoring Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **Asymmetry** | 25% | Is the downside capped at time/minor capital while upside is 10x+? |
| **TAM clarity** | 15% | Is the market real and addressable at my scale? |
| **Unique edge** | 20% | Do I have access, knowledge, or speed that others lack? |
| **Speed to validation** | 15% | Can I get a market signal in <90 days? |
| **Capital efficiency** | 10% | Can this run on <$5k and <10h/week in early stage? |
| **Data moat potential** | 15% | Does this compound — does usage create defensibility? |

### Convexity Examples

**Armstrong (Convex)**
- Downside: Time + minor capital
- Upside: Fund management fees at scale (2/20 on AUM), category-defining platform
- Shape: Flat → flat → breakout at fund launch

**Consulting/contracting (Linear)**
- 10 hours → fixed income
- No curve. No compounding. No equity.
- Kill or minimize.

**Decision rule:** If the payoff curve is linear, it's a job. If it bends upward, it's a venture. Only hold ventures.

## IV. PORTFOLIO ARCHITECTURE

### Current Allocation

| Venture | Time | Role | Convexity Profile | Decision Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Armstrong** | 60% | Co-founder / Product | High — fund mgmt fees scale with AUM | Revenue signal by month 3 |
| **Manifold** | 15% | Solo builder | Medium — SaaS scales if PMF | 50 users or $500/mo by month 3, else kill |
| **Deep Tech Fund** | 5% | GP relationship | High — 2/20 on $20M+ AUM | GP commitment formalized by month 12 |
| **Geneticist in Your Pocket** | Evaluate | Operator-allocator | Very high — AI health layer, data moat, recurring SaaS | Pass convexity filter, find operator, seed with <$5k |
| **Jobs** | 1% | Safety net | Zero — linear income | Only activate if portfolio stalls for 12+ months |

### Portfolio Rules

1. **Max 3 active ventures** at any time. More = fragmentation, which is the primary failure mode.
2. **One spine project per season.** Everything else is satellite. The spine gets 60%+ of execution hours.
3. **Kill fast.** If a venture misses its decision gate, archive it within 2 weeks. No sunk-cost extensions.
4. **Every venture must have a named decision gate and a date.** No open-ended exploration.

## V. CAPITAL STRATEGY — BOOTSTRAP THEN RAISE

### The Sequence Matters

Most founders raise to validate. I validate to raise. The order is everything.

**Bootstrap phase → Revenue signal → Preseed from strength**

This is not anti-fundraising. It's anti-premature-fundraising. Raising before revenue means:
- Dilution at the lowest possible valuation
- Investor leverage over your time and direction
- Pressure to scale before understanding the market
- Loss of the autonomous holdco structure

Raising *after* revenue means:
- Higher valuation (proven demand)
- Investor comes as accelerant, not lifeline
- You keep control and meaningful equity
- You choose which venture gets the capital injection

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Months 0-12)

**Goal:** Prove that ventures can generate revenue on sweat equity + <$5k per venture.

| Input | Constraint |
|---|---|
| Capital per venture | <$5k (hosting, tools, minor costs) |
| Time per venture | Bounded by portfolio allocation |
| Revenue target | Enough to cover operating costs + signal PMF |
| Equity given away | Zero. 100% ownership preserved. |

**This phase answers:** Is this a real business, or a hobby with infrastructure?

**Kill criteria:** If a venture can't generate *any* revenue signal in 90 days on bootstrap, it likely won't generate meaningful revenue with $500k either. The problem is market fit, not capital.

### Phase 2: Preseed (When Earned)

**Trigger conditions — ALL must be true:**
1. Revenue exists (even small — $1-5k/mo proves demand is real)
2. Clear use of funds (specific growth lever, not "general operations")
3. Unit economics suggest the curve bends upward with capital (convexity preserved)
4. I've identified whether I'm the right operator to scale it, or need to recruit one

**What I'd raise for:**
- Accelerate a specific venture that passed the 90-day gate with revenue
- Hire one key operator/engineer (not a team — stay lean)
- Buy distribution (paid acquisition with proven CAC/LTV)
- NOT for runway. NOT for "figuring it out." NOT to feel safe.

**Target raise:** $150-500k preseed. Enough to accelerate, small enough to preserve meaningful equity.

**Ideal investor profile:**
- Operator-angel who's built in AI or fintech
- Hands-off on day-to-day, available for strategic leverage
- Comfortable with holdco structure (not expecting a single-company blitz-scale)
- Check size $25-100k

### Phase 3: Compound or Exit (Month 12+)

For each venture that survives to Phase 3, three paths:
1. **Hold and compound** — profitable, growing, keep 100% equity
2. **Raise seed to scale** — proven unit economics, raise $1-2M to capture market
3. **Sell or merge** — strategic acquirer values it more than I do, take the exit

The holdco structure means I'm never all-in on one outcome. If Venture A sells and Venture B compounds, the portfolio wins either way.

### Why Bootstrap-First Is The Edge

Most founders in 2026 are raising because they think they should. The market is flooded with pre-revenue companies holding $500k+ in capital they don't know how to deploy.

Bootstrap-first means:
- **I learn the market before I spend on it.** Revenue is the ultimate signal.
- **I negotiate from leverage.** "$3k/mo and growing" is a fundamentally different pitch than "I have an idea."
- **I keep optionality.** No board seats, no reporting obligations, no pressure to scale prematurely.
- **I build the muscle.** Bootstrapping forces resourcefulness. Fundraising often substitutes for it.

## VI. THE THESIS ENGINE — CORE ASSET

The Thesis Engine is not a productivity dashboard. It is the compounding knowledge asset that constitutes the moat.

### What It Does

| Function | Purpose | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Dealflow Tracker** | Who did I meet? What pain surfaced? What budget exists? | Pipeline of scored opportunities |
| **Insight Graph** | What themes cluster? Where is regulatory friction? Where is data underutilized? | Pattern recognition over time |
| **Conviction Scoring** | Score each idea on TAM, edge, speed, asymmetry, capital access | Kill/pursue decisions backed by data |
| **Network Intelligence** | Track allocators, operators, experts, buyers. Map who funds/buys/exits what. | Warm intro density, deal access |

### Why This Compounds

Each interaction — every conversation, signal captured, venture launched, idea killed — feeds back into the engine. The engine doesn't just track. It *learns*. After 100 ideas scored, my conviction accuracy should be measurably better than after 10.

This is the Bridgewater principle applied to a solo operator: **systematic, evidence-based decision-making that improves with each cycle.**

## VII. MONTHLY OPERATING KPIs

### Idea Flow
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|
| Raw ideas logged | 15+/month | <5 = not enough signal intake |
| Clustered themes identified | 3-5/month | 0 = not synthesizing |
| Validated by 2+ external signals | 3+/month | 0 = echo chamber |
| Ideas killed | 5+/month | 0 = not filtering ruthlessly |

### Capital Flow
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|
| Allocators spoken to | 2+/month | 0 = network atrophying |
| Warm intros created | 2+/month | 0 = not activating network |
| Potential check size tracked | Updated monthly | Stale = losing deal context |

### Operator Flow
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|
| High-skill operators met | 2+/month | 0 = building alone (doesn't scale) |
| Cofounder-potential relationships | 1+/quarter deepened | 0 = no leverage on next venture |

### Equity Flow
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|
| % ownership accumulated | Increasing quarterly | Decreasing = dilution without value |
| Implied portfolio EV | Growing | Flat for 2 quarters = thesis broken |
| Revenue from portfolio | On track per decision gates | Missing gates = kill or pivot |

### Execution Flow
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|
| Focus hours on spine | 6+/day, 5 days/week | <3/day = fragmentation |
| Public iterations shipped | 1+/week | 0 = perfectionism loop |
| Revenue asks made | 2+/day | 0 = avoiding the hard thing |
| Nervous system state | Regulated 5+/7 days | Spiked 3+ days = decision quality degraded |

## VIII. DECISION GATES — WHEN TO KILL, DOUBLE, OR PIVOT

### Gate Structure

Every venture gets a **90-day gate** and a **12-month gate**.

**90-Day Gate (Validation)**
- Is there a market signal? (Revenue, users, LOIs, partnership interest)
- Did I learn something that increases conviction?
- Is the convexity profile still intact?

**If no to all three: Kill.**

**12-Month Gate (Commitment)**
- Is this generating revenue or has clear path to revenue within 6 months?
- Am I the right operator, or should I find one and take equity?
- Does this still pass the convexity filter given what I now know?

**If no to two of three: Kill or restructure.**

### Current Gate Status

| Venture | Gate | Date | Success Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Armstrong | 90-day | Set per current milestone | $2k/mo revenue | Active |
| Manifold | 90-day | Set per current milestone | 50 users or $500/mo | Active |
| Deep Tech Fund | 12-month | Month 12 | GP terms formalized | Relationship phase |

## IX. EDGE ANALYSIS — WHY THIS WORKS

### Structural Advantages

1. **AI Literacy + Markets Intuition** — Most AI builders don't understand capital markets. Most finance people don't understand AI. I sit at the intersection.

2. **Speed + Rigor** — Academic depth (Stanford RL) with Levelsio-speed shipping. Most academics are slow. Most shippers are shallow. I am neither.

3. **Operator + Allocator Hybrid** — I can build the product AND structure the capital. This means I don't need to choose between sweat equity and financial equity.

4. **Nervous System as Alpha** — Regulated decision-making in a market full of emotionally hijacked founders. The 24-hour rule, the gate structure, the kill discipline — these are systematic edge, not personality.

5. **Compounding Insight Network** — Every conversation, signal, and venture feeds the Thesis Engine. My 100th bet will be structurally better than my 10th.

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Fragmentation (too many ventures) | Max 3 rule, spine lock, visible time allocation |
| Emotional decision-making | 24-hour rule, nervous system tracking, gate structure |
| Isolation (solo operator) | Monthly operator/allocator KPIs, network intelligence layer |
| Market timing | Speed to validation (<90 days), capital-light structure |
| Perfectionism | Weekly shipping cadence, embarrassment tolerance metric |

## XI. PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **If it's not convex, it's not in the portfolio.** Linear income is a job. Only hold asymmetric positions.

2. **Kill fast, compound slow.** The value is in the long game. But bad bets die in 90 days, not 3 years.

3. **Measure everything that matters, nothing that doesn't.** If it's not measured, it's romantic. If it doesn't drive equity value, stop measuring it.

4. **Decide from regulation, not anxiety.** The 24-hour rule is not optional. Spiked decisions are expensive decisions.

5. **One spine per season.** Fragmentation is the only structural risk that can kill this thesis. Guard against it above all else.

6. **Ship weekly, synthesize weekly, score monthly.** The rhythm is the edge. Consistency compounds. Brilliance doesn't.

7. **Revenue before raise.** Bootstrap proves demand. Capital accelerates demand. Never reverse the order.

8. **The Thesis Engine is the moat.** Everything else is replaceable. The compounding insight layer is not.
