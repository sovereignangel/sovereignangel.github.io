Examples:
  â"" Journalist covering AI + finance
  â"" Community manager (founder Slack, startup events)
  â"" Podcast host in your space
  â"" Angel investor known for intros
  â""...

TIER 3: PEER OPERATORS (10)

    â"" Invite: Events, peer cohort gathering, customer dinners

STAGE 6: COMPOUNDING PARTNERSHIP
Timeline: Year 2+

## RUIN CONDITIONS: THE THREE STOPS

If you see these, stop everything else and fix:

```
RUIN 1: FRAGMENTED NETWORK
Signal: All 30 are weak. Response rate <5%. No warm intros.
Cause: You're building 7 projects. Network doesn't know who you are.
Fix: Pick 10 from top 30. Touch each today. Share real progress.
Timeline: 2 weeks to recover signal

RUIN 2: MESSAGE UNCLEAR
Signal: Same ask, wildly different understanding of what you do.
Cause: Your thesis is confused or you're not being honest about edge.
Fix: Write one-liner. Test on 10 strangers daily. Refine.
Timeline: 1 week to clarity

RUIN 3: NO VALUE FLOWING
Signal: Every interaction is you asking. People avoid your DMs.
Cause: Credibility gap or bad timing (they're in survival mode).
Fix: Month of pure value. Zero asks. Intros, insights, capital.
Timeline: 4 weeks to reset
```

## THE LONG GAME: WHY THIS COMPOUNDS

Each layer builds on the previous:

1. **Clear message** → People understand what you do
2. **Repeated asks** → You learn what converts
3. **Top 30 relationships** → Warm intros flow
4. **Value delivery** → Trust builds, they advocate
5. **Rhythm + consistency** → You stay top of mind
6. **Storytelling** → Reputation grows (social proof)
7. **Peer cohort** → Network becomes a moat

By belt 6 (black):
- You don't ask anymore
- People compete to work with you
- Your network introductions matter (they open doors)
- Capital flows to you
- You shape markets (not just participate)

**This is how you go from $0 net worth to $10M.**

Not through luck. Through systems.

  â–¡ 60+ asks made (tracked)

WEEK 3-4:

```

**You have the system. Build it. Track it. Compound it.**

Each week, your message gets clearer.
Each month, your network strengthens.
Each quarter, your reputation grows.
By end of 2026, you're orange belt (40% warm intros, 80% conversion).
By 2027, you're raising fund with credibility.
By 2030, you're a $10M net worth capital allocator.

Not because you're smarter than everyone.
Because you're systematic.

---

**The belt system is your framework. The 30 contacts are your leverage. The 7 layers are your strategy. The 90-day sprint is your execution.**

Build this into Thesis Engine.
Track it obsessively.
Become inevitable.
