## GOAL 2: 55 VO2 MAX (Dec 2026)

### Current State Assessment
**First, measure where you are:**
- [ ] Garmin watch VO2 Max estimate: ____
- [ ] Or: Cooper Test (12-min run, measure distance)
- [ ] Or: Lab test (most accurate, $100-200)

### The Math: What It Takes

**VO2 Max improvement rate:** 5-15% in 3-6 months (with structured training)

**Assumptions:**
- Starting VO2 Max: 40 ml/kg/min (average for active women)
- Target VO2 Max: 55 ml/kg/min
- Gap: 15 points (37.5% increase)
- Time available: 10 months
- Required rate: **1.5 points/month** (challenging but achievable)

**Breakdown:**
- March 2026: 40 → 41.5 (+1.5)
- April 2026: 41.5 → 43 (+1.5)
- May 2026: 43 → 44.5 (+1.5)
- June 2026: 44.5 → 46 (+1.5)

- Nov 2026: 52 → 53.5 (+1.5)
- Dec 2026: 53.5 → 55 (+1.5)

### The System: Weekly Training Plan

**The science:** VO2 Max improves through high-intensity interval training (HIIT) + base aerobic fitness (Zone 2).

**Weekly structure (5-6 days/week):**

**Monday: VO2 Max Intervals** (45 min)
- Warm-up: 10 min easy jog
- Main set: 4-6 × 4 min @ 90-95% max HR
  - Rest: 3 min easy jog between intervals
- Cool-down: 10 min easy jog
- **This is THE session that moves VO2 Max**

**Tuesday: Zone 2 Base** (45-60 min)
- Easy run/bike at 60-70% max HR
- Build aerobic base (allows you to recover from intervals)

**Wednesday: Tempo Run** (40 min)
- Warm-up: 10 min easy
- Main: 20 min @ 80-85% max HR (comfortably hard)
- Cool-down: 10 min easy

**Thursday: Active Recovery** (30 min)
- Easy movement (walk, yoga, swim)
- Or: Strength training (squats, deadlifts, core)

**Friday: VO2 Max Intervals** (45 min)
- Same as Monday
- **Two VO2 sessions/week = fastest improvement**

**Saturday: Long Slow Distance** (60-90 min)
- Zone 2 pace (conversational)
- Build aerobic capacity

**Sunday: Rest or Active Recovery**
- Full rest or 30 min easy movement

### Automated Tracking (Garmin)

**Garmin tracks automatically:**
- VO2 Max estimate (updated after each run)
- Heart rate zones
- Training load (acute vs. chronic)
- Recovery time
- Running power (if you have Running Dynamics Pod)

**What to sync daily:**
- Current VO2 Max
- Weekly training load
- Resting heart rate (lower = better fitness)
- HRV (higher = better recovery)

**Dashboard metrics:**
- 📈 VO2 Max trajectory (current vs. target path)
- 🏃 Weekly VO2 intervals completed (target: 2)
- ❤️ Resting HR trend (should decrease over time)
- 📊 Training load balance (prevent overtraining)

### Milestones & Checkpoints

**March 2026:**
- ✅ Baseline VO2 Max measured
- ✅ 2 VO2 interval sessions/week locked in
- 🎯 Target: 41.5 VO2 Max

**June 2026:**
- ✅ 46 VO2 Max (10% improvement)
- ✅ Resting HR dropped 5-10 bpm
- ✅ Can complete 6 × 4 min intervals comfortably

**Sept 2026:**
- ✅ 50 VO2 Max (approaching elite amateur)
- ✅ Running economy improved (faster at same HR)
- ✅ Recovery time shorter

**Dec 2026:**
- 🏆 **55 VO2 Max achieved** (elite amateur range)
- 🏆 Resting HR <50 bpm
- 🏆 Feel energized, not depleted

### Risk Factors & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Overtraining (VO2 intervals are HARD)**
- Mitigation: Track HRV, if HRV drops >10% for 3 days → rest week

**Risk 2: Injury (high-intensity running)**
- Mitigation: Cross-train (bike, row, swim), strength training, proper shoes

**Risk 3: Plateau (VO2 Max stalls)**
- Mitigation: Vary interval duration (try 8 × 2 min or 3 × 6 min), check nutrition

- April 2026: $8k (+$2k)
- May 2026: $10k (+$2k)
- June 2026: $12k (+$2k)

**Required growth rate:** 33% month-over-month (aggressive)

**Breakdown by project:**

| Month | Armstrong (60%) | Manifold (15%) | Other (25%) | Total |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| March | $3,600 | $900 | $1,500 | $6,000 |
| April | $4,800 | $1,200 | $2,000 | $8,000 |
| May | $6,000 | $1,500 | $2,500 | $10,000 |
| June | $7,200 | $1,800 | $3,000 | $12,000 |

### The System: Revenue-Generating Actions

**Daily (non-negotiable):**
- [ ] **3 revenue asks** (not suggestions, ASKS)
  - Email potential customers
  - DM on Twitter/LinkedIn
  - Follow up on warm leads
  - Track: Who, What, Response
- [ ] **1 public iteration** (Armstrong or Manifold)
  - Ship feature, write post, record demo
  - Goal: Create FOMO (people see it, want it)

**Weekly:**
- [ ] **5 discovery conversations** (30 min each)
  - Find: What's broken? What would they pay for?
  - Qualify: Budget, authority, need, timeline
  - Ask: "If I built this, would you pay $X/month?"
- [ ] **1 pricing experiment**
  - Test: Higher price, bundle, annual discount
  - Measure: Conversion rate change
- [ ] **10 distribution actions**
  - Post on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, HN, IndieHackers
  - Goal: Drive traffic → trial signups

**Monthly:**
- [ ] **Churn analysis** (for existing customers)
  - Who cancelled? Why?
  - What would make them stay?
  - Fix the leaks before adding new customers
- [ ] **Conversion funnel audit**
  - Landing page → Trial → Paid conversion rate
  - Where's the drop-off?
  - A/B test 1 improvement

### Automated Tracking (Stripe + Bank APIs)

**What to sync daily:**
- Total revenue (MRR + one-time)
- Revenue by source (Armstrong, Manifold, other)
- Customer count
- Churn rate
- Average revenue per customer (ARPC)
- Conversion rate (trial → paid)

**Dashboard metrics:**
- 📈 Revenue trajectory (current vs. target path)
- 🎯 Gap to monthly goal (days remaining × required daily revenue)
- 💰 MRR vs. one-time revenue (recurring is better)
- 📉 Churn rate (aim for <5%)
- 🔄 Asks → Conversion rate (measure sales skill)

### Milestones & Checkpoints

**March 2026:**
- ✅ $6k revenue ($3.6k Armstrong, $900 Manifold)
- ✅ 3 asks/day habit locked in
- ✅ First Armstrong customer paying >$500/mo
- 🎯 Armstrong: 6-12 customers @ $300-600/mo

**April 2026:**
- ✅ $8k revenue (+33% growth)
- ✅ Conversion rate >10% (trial → paid)
- ✅ Armstrong: 10-16 customers

**May 2026:**
- ✅ $10k revenue (+25% growth)
- ✅ First annual contract ($5k+)
- ✅ Armstrong: 15-20 customers

**June 2026:**
- 🏆 **$12k revenue achieved**
- 🏆 Armstrong: 20-25 customers
- 🏆 Churn <5%
- 🏆 MRR >80% of total revenue (recurring)

### The Capture Ratio (κ) Focus

**Your biggest lever:** κ (value created → value captured)

**Current issue:** You create value but don't ask for money.

**Fix:**
- Track: Hours spent creating vs. hours spent asking
- Goal: 10:1 ratio (10 hours creating → 1 hour asking)
- **If ratio is >20:1, you're leaking value**

**Example:**
- Week 1: 40 hours building, 0 hours asking → κ = 0
- Week 2: 40 hours building, 4 hours asking (12 asks) → 2 conversions → κ = 0.3
- Week 3: 30 hours building, 6 hours asking (18 asks) → 5 conversions → κ = 0.6

**The math:** More asks = higher κ = more revenue

### Risk Factors & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Product-market fit failure (customers don't want it)**
- Mitigation: 5 discovery calls/week, ruthlessly kill features nobody uses

**Risk 2: Asking anxiety (you avoid sales)**
- Mitigation: 24-hour rule (if spiked, wait), ask sprint (10 asks in 2 days)

**Risk 3: Churn (customers leave faster than you add them)**
- Mitigation: Monthly churn analysis, fix top 3 reasons for cancellation

## INTEGRATION WITH REWARD SCORE

### How Goals Feed into g*

**Your reward score (g*) includes:**
- **GE:** VO2 Max training, dance (nervous system regulation)
- **ĠI:** AI learning, papers read
- **ĠVC:** Ships (Female LevelsIO), public posts
- **κ:** Revenue asks → conversions
- **Θ:** Chess (Mind pillar), AI (AI pillar), Revenue (Markets pillar)

**New addition: Goal Momentum (GM)**

```
GM = (Goals on track) / (Total goals)
```

If 5/6 goals are on track → GM = 0.83
If 2/6 goals are on track → GM = 0.33

**Goal momentum modulates your reward score:**

```
g* = (Base reward) × (1 + 0.2 × GM)
```

**Example:**
- Base g*: 7.0
- GM: 0.83 (5/6 goals on track)
- Final g*: 7.0 × (1 + 0.2 × 0.83) = 7.0 × 1.166 = **8.16**

**This creates a compounding effect:** When you're crushing your goals, your reward score gets a boost.
